Computational cost of- 
(1) Digital Signature Cost : Computational cost for generating digital signatures for file set 1. 
(2) AES Encryption Cost : Computational cost for encrypting/decrypting file set 1 using AES encryption. 
(3) RSA Encryption Cost : Computational cost for encrypting/decrypting file set 2.

Files are divided into two groups: 
(a) *-timed.py files are used  to calculate the time taken to run the files.
(b) files without "timed.py" extention are the actual codes for encryption/decryption.
